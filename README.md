# State of the Academy 2025

On April 9, The Phillipian, vol. CXLV, sent out the 2025 “State of the Academy” survey to all Andover students in the hopes of obtaining valuable information about the school community.

The Phillipian received a participation rate of 75.6 percent of the student body–867 participants. The anonymous survey asked a comprehensive set of 148 questions, comprised of nine sections: General, Politics & Worldview, Wellness, Sex, Drugs & Alcohol, School, Campus Culture, Community & Diversity, and Discipline.

To determine correlations, The Phillipian analyzed the CSV file of all responses from Survey Monkey with Python. The Phillipian proceeded to use PANDAS, matplotlib.plotly, and numpy libraries to find correlations between each question.

This year, the survey included content warnings that allowed participants to skip specific questions that may have been potentially triggering without viewing the question itself. We sincerely thank members of the student body for their willingness to share information and personal experiences for this special issue of The Phillipian, and we hope that the State of the Academy will serve to inform, enlighten, and create a more holistic narrative of the students at Andover.
